    <h1>Historical Perspective on Computing</h1>

    <div class = "intro"> The journey of computing is truly an exciting adventure that has wonderfully transformed our world. Computing has blossomed into a rich
        and varied field. The history of computers began with simple designs in the early 19th century and went on to make a significant impact
        during the 20th century. The term ‘computer’ has a delightful origin. It was first used in the 16th century to refer to a person who
        performed calculations. Before computers came into existence, folks relied on sticks, stones, and bones as their counting tools. As
        technology progressed and human creativity flourished over time, more computing devices were created. Let’s take a closer look at some of the history perspective on computing!
    </div>
    
    <h2>Evolution of Computing:</h2>

    <ul><div class = "subtopics">
        <li><u>First Generation: 1940s and 1950s</u></li>
            <div class = "info">The first generation of computers, using vacuum tubes, were bulky, expensive, and difficult to program.
                Operating without an operating systems, they were slow, performed single tasks and used magnetic tape for storage.
                Programming was quite a challenge back then since they were using a low-level machine language for their programming. Despite
                their limitations, they were reliable and capable of rapid calculations. Pioneers like Konrad Zuse (Z3) and British Colossus 
                contributed to these early machines, laying the foundation for modern computing.
            </div>
    <br>
        <li><u>Second Generation: 1950s and 1960s</u></li>
            <div class = "info">The improved second-generation computers brought a wonderful change by using transistors instead of those bulky vacuum tubes,
                resulting in machines that were smaller, faster, more efficient, and super reliable. They also made use of magnetic core memory,
                which was not only faster but also more dependable than the technologies that came before. These fantastic advancements led to
                better speed, accuracy, size, reliability, and energy efficiency. However, these machines still had their limitations, as they
                were designed for specific tasks and relied on punch card input, which needed a bit of regular maintenance. In 1954, IBM was
                thrilled to introduce the 650, marking the arrival of the first mass-produced computer.
            </div>
    <br>
        <li><u>Third Generation: 1964 - 1971</u></li>
            <div class = "info">The third-generation computers, which came with integrated circuits (semiconductors), were not only smaller
                but also faster and more affordable than the earlier models. Exciting new input/output devices such as monitors, keyboards,
                and printers took the place of the old technologies. Operating systems made multitasking possible, which meant computers could
                juggle several tasks at the same time. Although these machines were more reliable and compact, they did need some advanced
                manufacturing technology and a bit of formal user training to get started.
            </div>
    <br>    
        <li><u>Fourth Generation 1972 - 1980</u></li>
            <div class = "info"> During the early 1970s, computers predominantly established their presence within large institutions.
                Altair 8800, the first personal computer that really caught everyone's attention, was introduced in 1975. This wonderful
                invention came from the creative minds at Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems. It was equipped with a fantastic Intel
                8080 processor and 256 bytes of memory. Instead of a keyboard, users had the fun of entering programs and data through switches.
                With no monitor in sight, results were read by deciphering a pattern of small red lights.
            </div>
    <br>    
        <li><u>Fifth Generation 1981 - Present</u></li>
            <div class = "info"> Fifth-generation computers, which use cutting-edge ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) technology along with
                artificial intelligence, truly represent the pinnacle of computing. Since their launch in 1980, these exceptional machines have
                adopted parallel processing and superconductors to drive artificial intelligence applications. Popular programming languages
                like C, C++, JavaScript, and Python are widely embraced. Some examples of fifth-generation computers include IBM, Pentium,
                Desktop, Laptop, Notebook, Ultrabook, and more.
            </div>
    </div></ul>
    
    <h2>Key Milestone & Influential Figures:</h2>
    <ul><div class = "subtopics">

    <h1>Introduction to IT Basics</h1>
        <div class = "intro"> Information Technology, abbreviated as IT, pertains to the application of computers and advanced electronic tools
            for the purposes of storing, retrieving, sharing, and processing information.
        </div>

    <h2>Overview of Fundamental IT Concepts:</h2>
    <ul><div class = "subtopics">
        <li><u>Hardware</u></li>
            <div class = "info"> Think of hardware as the physical body of a computer. It's everything you can touch, like the monitor you see
                and the keyboard you type on. But there's more to it than meets the eye! Many important parts are hidden inside, like the
                motherboard (the brain), RAM (short-term memory), and CPU (the processor that does the calculations). Other hardware components
                include printers that let you get information out of the computer and external storage devices like hard drives, CDs, and DVDs
                that hold all your data and programs.   
            </div>
    <br>
        <li><u>Software</u></li>
            <div class = "info"> Software is like the brain of the computer. It's a set of instructions, written by programmers, that tell the
                hardware what to do. These instructions are like a special language that only computers understand. Just like you wouldn't use
                instructions written for French in an English class, software designed for one operating system (like Windows 7) might not work
                on a different one (like Windows 10). Compatibility is key!  
            </div>
    <br>
        <li><u>Networking</u></li>
            <div class = "info"> Networking is all about bringing together lots of computers and devices so they can share resources and chat
                with each other. It is like building a friendly digital neighborhood where all sorts of devices can connect and swap information.
                There are two main kinds of networks: Local Area Networks (LANs), which link devices in a limited space like your home or office,
                and Wide Area Networks (WANs), which connect devices over much larger distances, like the Internet. The Internet itself is a huge
                global network that uses Internet Protocol (IP) to make sure all devices can connect seamlessly.   
            </div>
    <br>
        <li><u>Role of IT in Modern Organizations</u></li>
            <div class = "info"> The role of Information Technology has certainly evolved into a fundamental aspect of present-day organizations,
                providing numerous advantages. By automating tasks and processes, IT makes everything run smoother and helps cut costs. It elevates
                communication through handy tools like email and video conferencing, encouraging collaboration and teamwork. Moreover, Information
                Technology supplies essential data and insights that enhance decision-making and aid organizations in detecting trends and
                opportunities. On top of that, IT is essential for keeping sensitive information safe and guarding against cyber threats.
